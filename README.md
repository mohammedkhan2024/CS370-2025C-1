## Pirate Intelligent Agent

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
- For this project, I worked on implementing deep Q-learning for a treasure hunt game where a pirate must find a treasure in a maze. The given code included two Python classes: TreasureMaze.py, which defined the maze environment, and GameExperience.py, which stored the pirate’s learning experiences. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook was provided with a basic game setup and an incomplete deep Q-learning implementation. My task was to complete the Q-learning algorithm in the notebook, specifically filling in the missing logic for training the pirate to find the optimal path. The completed code was implemented under the TODO comments, and I followed the given pseudocode to complete the implementation.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
- Computer scientists develop software, algorithms, and systems that solve real-world problems. Their work is important because technology plays a major role in various industries, from healthcare to finance and entertainment. In this project, I applied artificial intelligence concepts, specifically reinforcement learning to teach an agent, the pirate, to make smart decisions. This kind of problem solving is used in many fields, such as self driving cars and recommendation systems. Understanding how machines learn and improve is crucial to advancing automation and intelligent systems.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I start by understanding the given requirements and identifying what needs to be built or fixed. In this project, I first reviewed the provided code and the missing parts. I then followed the given pseudocode then broke down the problem into smaller steps. First I initialized the environment, defining the pirate’s actions, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Then testing and debugging were also important, as I needed to make sure the pirate learned the best path to the treasure. This step by step approach helps in solving complex problems efficiently.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
- As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to both users and the organizations I work for. In this project, fairness and accuracy were make sure the pirate learned correctly and did not take unfair shortcuts. In a real world setting, ethical considerations include making sure AI systems are unbiased and designing software that is safe and reliable. For example, in AI applications like self driving cars or medical diagnostics, errors can have serious consequences. It is essential to create systems that prioritize user safety, privacy, and fairness while also aligning with the organization’s goals.
